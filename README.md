# Dynamic NFT Demo using Chainlink Automation

**To be used as an example during workshops**

The following tools were used to build this:
- Remix
- Pinata Gateway 
- Chainlink Automation

The fully working "field" of dNFTs is shown below, where a NFT has "evolved" into a sunflower, another into a seedling, while the two others have stayed in the seed stage - I love this analogy.

Each NFT has different metadata, as seen below.

## Powered by Chainlink

The use cases are immense and I can't wait to see everyone's amazing products and "fields of sunflowers".
